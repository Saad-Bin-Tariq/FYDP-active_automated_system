# ACTIVE AUTOMATED SENSING SYSTEM FOR URBAN TURBULENT AND RADIANT HEAT - DYDP 2024 IGIS, NUST

## Overview

The **Active Automated Sensing System for Urban Turbulent and Radiant Heat** is a comprehensive project aimed at monitoring and mitigating the impacts of micro-climate changes in urban areas. This project leverages Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and real-time sensing systems to analyze urban heat islands and the cooling effects of different tree species. The project integrates several technologies, including IoT sensors, Machine Learning, and a React-based web dashboard, to provide insights for sustainable urban planning and climate change adaptation.

### Project Components
1. **Data Collection:**
   - **QField:** Used for collecting data on 45 species of trees.
   - **IoT Sensors:** 8000 samples of temperature and humidity data were collected using four different types of sensors, including static, portable with GPS, and solar-powered sensors.
   - **Drone Imaging:** 37 drone flights captured over 7000 images of the study area.

2. **Machine Learning:**
   - **Model:** XGBoost Regression Model was used to predict indoor temperature.
   - **Features:** The model considers various features such as tree species, distance to buildings, distance to water bodies, tree density, building density, and outdoor temperature.
   - **Performance:** The model achieved an RÂ² Score of 0.8593 after hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Web Dashboard:**
   - **Frontend:** Built with React, the dashboard displays sensor data, heatmaps, a digital twin, and tree data with pictures and species information.
   - **Backend:**
     - **Flask:** Hosts the ML model for indoor temperature prediction.
     - **Node.js:** Collects and stores temperature and humidity data from sensors.
   - **Hosting:** The dashboard is live at [https://dashboard.aiaware.com.pk/](https://dashboard.aiaware.com.pk/).

4. **GIS as a Service:**
   - The system harnesses GIS to provide valuable insights across various use cases, such as identifying bio-climatic variables, insect-prone areas, heat zones, and the cooling effects of different tree species.

### Key Findings
- Certain tree species, such as **Red Bottle Brush** and **River Tea Tree**, have been identified to significantly lower temperatures.
- Trees like **Pilkhan** and **Bishop Tree** showed little to no effect on temperature mitigation.
- The ideal new building site was identified to have a cooling effect if planned at a moderate distance from existing structures.
- It was observed that tree species provide a certain cooling effect as long as they are not densely planted.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Backend - Flask**
   - Contains the code for the ML model that predicts indoor temperature.
   - Flask API endpoints serve predictions based on the input parameters.
   - Directory: `Flask-Backend/`

### 2. **Backend - Node.js**
   - Handles the collection and storage of temperature and humidity data from IoT sensors.
   - Provides APIs to fetch sensor data for the frontend dashboard.
   - Directory: `Node-Backend/`

### 3. **Frontend - React**
   - The React-based dashboard displays sensor data, heatmaps, digital twin, and tree data.
   - Integrates with both the Flask and Node.js backends to provide real-time insights.
   - Directory: `React-Frontend/`

### 4. **IoT Sensor Codes**
   - Contains the code for all types of sensors (static, portable with GPS, and solar).
